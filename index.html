                    <p>He doesn't fight crime</br>
                        Or wear a cape</br>
                        He doesn't read minds</br>
                        Or levitate</br>
                        But every time my world needs saving</br>
                        He's my Superman</br>
                        Some folks don't believe in heroes</br>
                        'Cause they haven't met my dad</br>
                        He loves his workshop</br>
                        And rock 'n roll</br>
                        He's got a hot rod</br>
                        And a heart of gold</br>
                        And you could say he's a man of few words</br>
                        But he talks a lot within</br>
                        And even though I'm a little taller</br>
                        I still look up to him</br>
                        He built me a house in the arms of a tree</br>
                        He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream</br>
                        When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see that</br>
                        My dad's a hero to me</br>
                        Rust ridden fenders</br>
                        And doors full of dings</br>
                        Somehow he can fix about anything</br>
                        I didn't think he knew how to cry</br>
                        'Til our dog died that year</br>
                        He doesn't always say I love you</br>
                        But I can hear him loud and clear</br>
                        He built me a house in the arms of a tree</br>
                        He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream</br>
                        When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see</br>
                        That my dad's a hero to me</br>
                        He built me a house in the arms of a tree</br>
                        He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream</br>
                        When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see</br>
                        That my dad's a hero to me</br>

                            Understanding between a father and son goes a long way
                            And we definitely have that

                            I can't thank you enough for all that you've given me.
                            </br></br>
                            You're strong, really strong. A man that would spend his entire life building a castle.
                            Then burn it all down in the blink of an eye if it meant we could have a mouth full.
                            </br></br>
                            I joke around alot about how we can't work together, but the truth is, yes we bud heads
                            but right after we find common ground there is nothing that can stand in our way.
                            I have learnt and continue to learn so many things from you.

                            Thank you for being a father like no other.
